## Data Cleaning/Formatting

This command was used to standardize the data

`python format.py`

Note that the the inputs and outputs need to be changed to the respective values for each class being formatted. It takes a folder of images, and outputs the formatted version of these images.
Also note that the greyscale line was commented out. This line was only used for the engaged dataset. Since the other datasets are already black and white.
